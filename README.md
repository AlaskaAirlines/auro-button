### Design Token CSS Custom Property dependency

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/development/designTokens.md) -->
The use of any Auro custom element has a dependency on the [Auro Design Tokens](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/developers/design-tokens).

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

### CSS Custom Property fallbacks

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/cssFallbacks.md) -->
[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) are [not supported](https://auro.alaskaair.com/support/custom-properties) in older browsers. For this, fallback properties are pre-generated and included with the npm.

Any update to the Auro Design Tokens will be immediately reflected with browsers that support CSS custom properties, legacy browsers will require updated components with pre-generated fallback properties.

### Define dependency in project component

## Install bundled assets from CDN

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/bundleInstallDescription.md) -->
In cases where the project is not able to process JS assets, there are pre-processed assets available for use. See -- `auro-button__bundled.js` for modern browsers. Legacy browsers such as IE11 are no longer supported.

We recommend you load these bundles using [differential serving](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/) so that the browser only loads the bundle correctly. To accomplish this, the script tag for the modern bundle should have `type="module"` and the script tag.

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

### Bundle example code

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/bundleUse.md) -->

```html
<!-- **NOTE:** Be sure to replace `@latest` in the URL with the version of the asset you want. @latest is NOT aware of any MAJOR releases, use at your own risk. -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@alaskaairux/design-tokens@latest/dist/tokens/CSSCustomProperties.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@aurodesignsystem/webcorestylesheets@latest/dist/bundled/essentials.css" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@aurodesignsystem/auro-button@latest/dist/auro-button__bundled.js" type="module"></script>
```

## Responsive support

`<auro-button>` is responsive by default. The button will assume 100% of the width of its container for views less than [auro_breakpoint--sm](https://alaskaairlines.github.io/WebCoreStyleSheets/#responsive-mixin-auro_breakpoint--sm).

Beyond that breakpoint `<auro-button>` will assume the width of the content or a min-width of `8.75rem`, which ever is greater.

If the desired appearance of the `<auro-button>` is to be placed in the reverse direction of natural content, then the attributes of `responsive` and `reverse` are needed on the `<auro-button>` element.

## Multi button support

When the UI requires the use of multiple buttons within the same space, with the use of the [Auro Web Core Style Sheets](https://alaskaairlines.github.io/WebCoreStyleSheets/#utility-auro-css-#{$scope}.auro_containedButtons), and the `auro_containedButtons` .

## auro-button use cases

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../docs/partials/useCases.md) -->
<!-- The below content is automatically added from ./../docs/partials/useCases.md -->
The auro-button element should be used in situations where users may:

* submit a form
* begin a new task
* trigger a new UI element to appear to the page
* specificy a new or next step in a process
