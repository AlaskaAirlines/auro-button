<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT This file is to be used for any additional content that should be included in the README.md which is specific to this component. -->
## Responsive support

`<auro-button>` is responsive by default. The button will assume 100% of the width of its container for views less than [auro_breakpoint--sm](https://alaskaairlines.github.io/WebCoreStyleSheets/#responsive-mixin-auro_breakpoint--sm).

Beyond that breakpoint `<auro-button>` will assume the width of the content or a min-width of `8.75rem`, which ever is greater.

If the desired appearance of the `<auro-button>` is to be placed in the reverse direction of natural content, then the attributes of `responsive` and `reverse` are needed on the `<auro-button>` element.

## Multi button support

When the UI requires the use of multiple buttons within the same space, with the use of the [Auro Web Core Style Sheets](https://alaskaairlines.github.io/WebCoreStyleSheets/#utility-auro-css-#{$scope}.auro_containedButtons), and the `auro_containedButtons`.
